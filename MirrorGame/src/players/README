The player system will be implemented as a tree.  There will be a maximum of 6 players and a minimum of 1.
This will be made so that we can make implementations of players that are not connected to the tree for individual levels,
or levels where such abstraction would simply detract from efficiency without making up for it though any other
advantages.

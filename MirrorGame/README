  I'm probably not gonna work too much on this for now, so I leave it up to you two.  You guys can implement the players and levels
however you want, but I suggest following the given instructions/current plans.  If you have any questions ask me.  I'm trying to
set up a bitcoin faucet so I can get a steady source of revenue.  This is so that we can get our game out there better.  We do not
have a good setup for art, and limited resources for music (which I will be working on).  Once I get a steady source of revenue, we can
more easily get better professional looking art for our game.  I plan to get this on steam greenlight, and if I remember correctly you
have to pay 100-150$ to get a game on there, plus we might need some marketing to get our name out there.  I will also look into other 
ways to monetize our game.  BTW, we do not necessarily have to make this our debut project, we can get something else out there.  Either
way, I want to publish something in the coming couple years, and while it is possible, I think it will be difficult to get something off
the ground with a budget of literally 0$.  With just a few hundred bucks we can go much farther.

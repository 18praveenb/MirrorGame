# MirrorGame

Work on: a level creator, collisions, standard and menu levels.  Player Tree also needs to be worked on.

Add: sounds and graphics

Adriano is working on level writers/readers.

Patrick is working on collisions, player trees and movements, and screen scaling.
  (I need some help figuring out why the scaling is imperfect)

Edgar is working on cleaning up.

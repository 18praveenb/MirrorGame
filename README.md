# ParallelWorldGame_AndroidPhone

This is my solo rework branch.  I'm gonna work on all aspects of the game here along a slightly different path.
If it works I will implement it into the master.


Ok, so this is an unfinished version of what we will have but it works fine.  It's not as batshit as master,
and I will be adding much more soon.  Don't make too many big changes until the groundwork has been put in place.
(I will do it so that we can get consistency).  I'm gonna add more functionality to get it to work with our folders
in C:\Spaghetti.  I will probably also improve this to be somewhere outside of C:\ since it is not elegant to  have
it be there, (plus it requires root access I think) < ofc this has to work on any PC with any user.

Work on: a level creator, sound for the game, collisions, graphics.

If you don't know what to do right now, ask me and I will respond as soon as I can.  In the meanwhile work
on assets such as sound and graphics.

If you do work on some code, don't make it batshit disorganized please.  I tried to make it easy to understand and
nicely organized, and it would be nice to keep it like this.

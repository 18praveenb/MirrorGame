# ParallelWorldGame_AndroidPhone

We are making this for PC/Mac first.  It is being made in eclipse.  If we feel that it is well done, we might search for PC distriution options; otherwise, we will continue onto the porting of the project to Android Phone, and perhaps iOS later.  If we feel it is not good enough and that porting it over to Android phone would be pointless, we will begin anew with a fresh idea.



Edgar is working on Level design and the likes, Patrick is working on the system, Adriano is working on the player(s).  If you finish early you can begin on something, try to make sure you don't work concurrently on the same thing with someone else, so ask them if you can.  If there is a new piece of code that functions well alone, but has not been implemented into the rest of the game, implement it.  Better assets will be added later, rightnow we are using MS paint style graphics and no sounds.



I have made it so that only Adriano, Edgar, and Patrick can directly edgit the master branch.  However, DON'T JUST DO IT.  Please, test your code and create a new parallel branch before just implementing changes.

I, Adriano, am gonna try and aquire funds and distribution opporutnities to either get this game published, or our next one and in a
monetizable fashion.
